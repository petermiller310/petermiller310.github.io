# blog posts post agi

remember when stack overflow was the go-to source for learning how to build stuff? 
you'd spend hours googling random error messages, digging through threads 
with 20+ answers (half of them outdated) all hoping to find that one dev who'd solved your exact problem.

now you can just use cursor or windsurf in a single prompt and it'll fix it for you.

and if you're wondering just how much $$$ you can funnel into ai tools, here's a helpful breakdown:

| tool | cost |
|---------|------|
| windsurf pro | $15/mo |
| cursor pro | $20/mo |
| chatgpt plus | $20/mo |
| claude pro | $20/mo |
| chatgpt pro | $200/mo |

## what's the point of blogs in 2025?

so i've been thinking a lot lately: what's the point of a blog in this post-agi world?

when i can ask claude to "explain kubernetes networking in simple terms" and get a better explanation than 99% of technical blog posts out there, why am i still writing? when ai can instantly generate tutorials, debug complex errors, and write elegant code solutions that would take me hours to figure out, what's the point of my human-crafted content anymore?

here's the thing: blogs aren't just information dumps anymore. they can't be. information is basically free now.

writing forces you to organize your thoughts in a way that chatting with an ai doesn't. the act of blogging isn't just about the output - it's about the process of thinking deeply enough about something that you can explain it to others.

so yeah, maybe the traditional "how-to" blog post is dead. maybe the "10 tips for better javascript" posts are now ai-generated noise. but the human blog - the weird, specific, subjective, unoptimized human blog - might be more valuable than ever.

or maybe not.

after all, the irony isn't lost on me that LLMs are now good enough to generate synthetic posts that perfectly mimic this exact type of "authentic human perspective" i'm describing. they can fabricate personal anecdotes, inject just the right amount of self-doubt, and even throw in those little idiosyncrasies that make writing feel genuine.

hell, for all you know, an AI wrote this entire post.
